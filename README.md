# Development

Your new jumpstart project includes basic organization with an organized `assets` folder and a `components` folder.
If you chose to develop with the router feature, you will also have a `views` folder.

```
project/
├─ assets/ # Any assets that are used by the app should be placed here
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.rs # The entrypoint for the app. It also defines the routes for the app.
│  ├─ components/
│  │  ├─ mod.rs # Defines the components module
│  │  ├─ hero.rs # The Hero component for use in the home page
│  ├─ views/ # The views each route will render in the app.
│  │  ├─ mod.rs # Defines the module for the views route and re-exports the components for each route
│  │  ├─ blog.rs # The component that will render at the /blog/:id route
│  │  ├─ home.rs # The component that will render at the / route
├─ Cargo.toml # The Cargo.toml file defines the dependencies and feature flags for your project
```

### Automatic Tailwind (Dioxus 0.7+)

As of Dioxus 0.7, there no longer is a need to manually install tailwind. Simply `dx serve` and you're good to go!

Automatic tailwind is supported by checking for a file called `tailwind.css` in your app's manifest directory (next to Cargo.toml). To customize the file, use the dioxus.toml:

```toml
[application]
tailwind_input = "my.css"
tailwind_output = "assets/out.css"
```

### Tailwind Manual Install

To use tailwind plugins or manually customize tailwind, you can can install the Tailwind CLI and use it directly.

1. Install npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
2. Install the Tailwind CSS CLI: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli
3. Run the following command in the root of the project to start the Tailwind CSS compiler:

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./input.css -o ./assets/tailwind.css --watch
```

### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```

### Agent Configuration

The application includes an autonomous agent that researches topics and visualizes them on the canvas.
To configure the agent:
1. Click the "Settings" button in the top right corner.
2. Select your AI provider (OpenAI or Anthropic).
3. Enter your API Key.
4. Customize the Model name (e.g., `gpt-4o` or `claude-3-5-sonnet`).
5. Set the Research Topic and System Prompt.
6. Click "Save & Restart Agent".

The agent runs on the server side and will periodically update the board.
